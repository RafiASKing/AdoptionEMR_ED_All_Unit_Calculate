This notebook is built to calculate adoption metrics at the units (hospital branches) level and aggregated for the entire network. It is intentionally lightweight (non-dashboard) and can be run as-is in any Jupyter environment.

no confidential or office or client data is included. 

This is for my personal work use only.
